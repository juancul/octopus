You can trigger your WooCommerce checkout offers based on the target Category of products, For example, if anyone purchases a product from the Electronics category then your Order Bump offer will be triggered and the offer will be shown.

Setting up the target category saves a lot of time from adding individual products as targets and you can set up related upsell offers that will show up for the right category.

The Order Bumps can be scheduled for specific weekdays which can make them exclusive and available only for that set period of time.

6) Make the funnel Live and save changes.


=I installed the plugin, created Order Bumps, and added the offers too but still, it does not show up on purchasing the target products, why?=

If your order bump offers are not displaying on your site, make sure:
1. Your Order Bump offer is Live and not in sandbox mode.
2. You have added the correct target product or target category product in the cart.
3. Your Order Bump Schedule is set to Daily or for the correct weekday that you are checking.


=Can I customize the Order Bump Offers?=

Yes, the Order Bump Offers are completely customizable at the admin panel. While creating your order bump offer, you can select the offer layout from three default offer templates, customize its design and content with a live preview feature, as per your needs.

=For variable offer products why there is no drop-down to select variation?=

For a Variable Offer product as soon as the customer will tick the checkbox to accept the offer, a variation pop-up will appear with respective variations, variation product images, and offer prices.

=Can I change the location where the offer should be shown?=

Yes, you can change the location of the Order Bump Offer on the Checkout page. Here is the list of the available locations:

1.Before Order Summary.
2.Before Payment Gateways.
3.After Payment Gateways.
4.Before Place Order Button.

=If the offer product is being added in the cart then isn't that possible that the customer will add more than 1 quantity? This could lead us to a loss in revenue as well as stock. How could I prevent this?=

We have set quantity limit functionality, so the customer can only add a single quantity of the offer product. Also, the offer product quantity can't be updated from the cart page.

=What happens if the customer has already added the product in the cart that I was going to show as a bump offer?=

In this case, you can skip the bump offer. To do this, go to the “Global Settings” of our Order Bump plugin. There you’ll find a feature named “Skip for Same Offers.” Click on the dropdown in front of it and select Yes and save changes. Now if a customer has added an order bump offer product in his cart, the plugin won’t show them the same product as the bump offer.

=What happens to the bump offer product if the customer removes the target product from the cart?=

In this case, you get two options. Either to remove or keep the offer product in the customer's cart. To do this, you need to go to the Order Bump plugin’s 'Global Settings' > 'Offer Target Dependency' feature, you’ll see two options here:

“Remove offer when target product is removed” - As the Target product is removed the offer product associated with the target will also be removed from your customer's cart.

“Keep offer when target product is removed” - As the Target product is removed the offer product associated with the target will be converted into a normal product in your customer's cart.

=Can I offer subscription products as Order bumps?=

Yes, our plugin supports Simple, Variable, and Subscription products.

=Can I track the performance of my Order Bumps?=

Yes, we have Order Bump - Behavioral Analytics that shows Individual Order Bump Performance metrics such as View Count, Success Count, Offer Accept Count, Offer Remove Count, Conversion Rate, and Total Sales. With the help of these metrics, you can easily figure out how your Order Bumps are performing and make changes accordingly.

<p>Customize this page to meet your needs. This is done from the wp-admin Pages menu for this title. Here are some things you might might want to leverage on this page:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provide Context</strong> - Tell the user why they are there. e.g. In order to checkout you\'ll need to get verified.</li>
<li><strong>Shortcode: \'tot-reputation-status\'</strong> - recommended and used above. inserts a text description of the users current state. If they are not yet verified adds a link to get verified.</li>
<li><strong>Shortcode: \'tot-wp-embed\'</strong> - (use with caution) includes a variety of widgets that allow the user to see their current status. These include buttons that could lead users away from the flow you intend.  <a href="https://tokenoftrust.com/docs/integrations/wordpress/#common-pages">More information.</a></li>
<li><strong>Auto-launch when not verified: \'auto-launch-when-not-verified\'</strong> - search for this attribute on this pre-defined page and set to "true" to auto-launch. Be careful here - we recommend you do this only if your users are prepared for a popup to get them verified. We not auto-launching and instead setting the stage by telling them what is going to happen and then letting them click a button to get started.</li>

</ul>
